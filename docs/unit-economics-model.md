## 3. KEY UNIT ECONOMICS METRICS

### Primary Metrics

| Metric | Value | Industry Benchmark | Status |
|--------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| **Blended CAC (Year 1)** | ₹4,000 | ₹3,000-₹5,000 | ✅ Within range |
| **LTV (Conservative)** | ₹30,000 | ₹20,000-₹40,000 | ✅ Competitive |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | 7.5x | >3x healthy | ✅ Excellent |
| **Payback Period** | 1.8 months | <12 months healthy | ✅ Strong |
| **Gross Margin** | 68% | 60-75% | ✅ Solid |

### Payback Period Calculation

**Assuming subscription model (70% margin):**
- Monthly subscription revenue to platform: ₹2,450 (₹3,500 × 70%)
- CAC to recover: ₹4,000
- Payback period: 4,000 ÷ 2,450 = **1.63 months**

**Including initial consultation margin:**
- First month revenue: ₹450 (consultation) + ₹2,450 (subscription) = ₹2,900
- Second month revenue: ₹2,450
- Cumulative after 2 months: ₹5,350
- **Payback achieved in ~1.8 months**

## 4. SUBSCRIPTION MODEL ASSUMPTIONS

### Average Customer Lifecycle

| Phase | Duration | Monthly Subscription Price | Churn Rate | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------------------------|------------|-------|
| **Onboarding** | Month 1 | ₹3,500 | 15% | High drop-off if no early wins |
| **Active Treatment** | Months 2-6 | ₹3,500 | 5% | Engaged, seeing results |
| **Maintenance** | Months 7-12 | ₹3,500 or ₹2,500 (reduced) | 10% | Lower intensity, may downgrade |
| **Long-term** | Month 12+ | ₹2,500 | 15% | Lifestyle maintenance phase |

### Average Subscription Duration

**Calculation:**
- 100 customers start
- After Month 1: 85 remain (15% churn)
- After Month 6: 85 × (1-0.05)^5 = 66 remain
- After Month 12: 66 × (1-0.10)^6 = 35 remain
- After Month 18: 35 × (1-0.15)^6 = 14 remain

**Average subscription length: ~8.2 months**

### Cohort Retention Model

| Month | % Retained | Monthly Revenue per Cohort (100 users) | Cumulative Revenue |
|-------|------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 100% | ₹2,45,000 | ₹2,45,000 |

### Key Insights from Unit Economics Validation

**✅ What Works:**
1. **LTV:CAC ratio of 7.5x is excellent** - validates business model sustainability
2. **Fast payback period (1.8 months)** - low capital intensity per customer
3. **High gross margins (68-71%)** - software/platform leverage

**⚠️ Adjustments to Original Projections:**
1. **Year 1 EBITDA more negative** - original deck showed -20%, reality is closer to -180%
   - **Reason:** Heavy upfront investment in tech and operations
2. **Year 2 EBITDA more conservative** - original showed +10%, revised to +13%
   - **Reason:** Need continued investment in user acquisition at scale
3. **Year 3 looks stronger** - original showed +25%, revised shows +38%
   - **Reason:** Operating leverage kicks in, CAC drops, retention generates recurring revenue
