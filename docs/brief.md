# Project Brief: MetaboWell

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** November 2, 2025  
**Prepared By:** Mary, Business Analyst  
**Status:** Draft for Review

---

## Executive Summary

**MetaboWell** is India's first doctor-led metabolic health ecosystem, combining in-person endocrinologist consultations (in Visakhapatnam) with digital follow-up care, GLP-1 therapy management, and holistic lifestyle support. The platform addresses the critical gap in Indian healthcare where patients receive prescriptions but lack ongoing support, coordination, and community—especially critical for GLP-1 medications that require long-term management, side effect monitoring, and lifestyle integration.

**Primary Problem:** Obese and metabolically compromised Indians struggle with fragmented healthcare—scattered consultations, no continuity of care, lack of GLP-1 expertise, and absence of integrated support (nutrition, diagnostics, pharmacy, community). Existing solutions are either digital-only (lacking trust), transactional (no ongoing relationships), or hospital-based (expensive and inconvenient).

**Target Market:** Adults 30-55 in Tier-1 and Tier-2 India (starting with Visakhapatnam) with obesity (BMI 30+), Type-2 diabetes, PCOS, or metabolic disorders who have tried traditional weight loss methods unsuccessfully.

**Key Value Proposition:** "Your metabolic health partner for life—not just an app, not just a consultation, but a relationship with your endocrinologist, nutritionist, and community, all coordinated through one platform."

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

**The Metabolic Health Crisis in India:**
- 135M+ Indians living with obesity and metabolic disorders
- $3.7B weight management market (2024), growing at 9.5% CAGR
- GLP-1 medications (Mounjaro, Ozempic, Wegovy) are revolutionary but require expertise and ongoing support

**Patient Journey Fragmentation:**
1. **Initial Consultation:** Patients visit doctors who may lack GLP-1 expertise or prescribe without comprehensive diagnostics
2. **No Ongoing Support:** Doctors follow "examine and prescribe" model—patients abandoned after prescription
3. **Side Effect Management:** GLP-1 side effects (nausea, constipation, fatigue) emerge but no accessible support
4. **Plateau Frustration:** Weight loss plateaus common, but no timely medical guidance
5. **Lifestyle Integration:** Dietician support critical but fragmented—patients must find separately
6. **Medication Access:** Pharmacy coordination and affordability challenges
7. **Long-term Maintenance:** Rebound after stopping medication—no structured off-ramp or maintenance protocols

### Impact of the Problem

**Quantified Impact:**
- **Yo-yo dieting costs:** Patients spend ₹50,000-₹1,00,000 on failed weight loss attempts over years
- **Diabetes complications:** Untreated metabolic disorders lead to ₹1L+ hospitalization costs
- **Lost productivity:** Obesity/metabolic disorders reduce work performance, increase sick days
- **Emotional toll:** Shame, frustration, isolation—patients feel like failures

**Healthcare System Gaps:**
- Doctors see 25-30 patients/day—no time for ongoing support
- Telemedicine platforms (Practo, Apollo) offer transactions, not relationships
- GLP-1 programs (HealthifyRx) are digital-only, metro-centric, coach-led (not doctor-led)
- No integrated platforms combining endocrinology + nutrition + diagnostics + pharmacy + community

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**HealthifyRx (Primary Competitor):**
- ❌ Digital-only—no physical consultations (trust barrier in Tier-2)
- ❌ Coach-led, not endocrinologist-led (medical complexity not addressed)
- ❌ Weight loss focus only (ignores PCOS, diabetes, hormonal health)
- ❌ Premium pricing (₹48K-₹80K) excludes Tier-2 market
- ❌ No regional language support

**General Telemedicine (Practo, Apollo, Tata 1mg):**
- ❌ Marketplace model—no continuity of care (different doctor each time)
- ❌ Transactional consultations—no structured programs
- ❌ No GLP-1 expertise or protocols
- ❌ No community or lifestyle support integration

**Hospital-Based Programs:**
- ❌ Expensive and inconvenient (travel time, wait times)
- ❌ Fragmented departments (endocrinology, nutrition, pharmacy separate)
- ❌ "Prescribe and abandon" model persists

**Regional Players:**
- ❌ Limited specialized metabolic health platforms in Tier-2 cities
- ❌ No technology integration or digital follow-up
- ❌ Fragmented individual practitioners

### Urgency and Importance

**Market Timing Factors:**
1. **GLP-1 Revolution:** Ozempic approved Oct 2024, Mounjaro launched in India (becoming 2nd highest selling branded drug Aug 2025)
2. **Generic Arrival:** Semaglutide patents expire 2026—Indian pharma will flood market, 85-90% cost reduction (₹30K → ₹3K/month)
3. **Tier-2 Telemedicine Boom:** 7x growth in online consultations in Tier-2 cities (Practo data)
4. **Eli Lilly Investment:** $1B plant in India signals long-term commitment to GLP-1 market
5. **Competitive Window:** 24-36 month window before well-funded players (Mosaic, Apollo) enter metabolic health vertically

**Why Solve This Now:**
- First-mover advantage in Tier-2 metabolic health category
- GLP-1 medications require specialized support—early platform captures trust
- Capital-efficient regional dominance possible before national scale
- Founder's local credibility (Chamber of Commerce past president) creates defensible moat

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept and Approach

**MetaboWell** is a hybrid metabolic health platform that combines:

1. **Physical Consultations in Visakhapatnam** → Builds trust (critical in Tier-2)
2. **Digital Follow-up India-Wide** → Convenience and scalability
3. **Endocrinologist-Led Care** → Medical rigor for complex metabolic disorders
4. **Integrated Ecosystem** → Doctors + Labs + Pharmacy + Dieticians + Community in ONE platform
5. **Longitudinal Programs** → 6-12 month relationships, not one-off consultations
6. **Transparent Pricing** → ₹3,500/month standard, ₹6,000/month with GLP-1 (plus medication)

### Key Differentiators from Existing Solutions

| Differentiator | MetaboWell | Competitors |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Service Model** | Hybrid (physical + digital) | Digital-only or hospital-only |
| **Medical Leadership** | Endocrinologist-led | Coach-led or marketplace |
| **Care Continuity** | Assigned doctor (same throughout journey) | Random doctors (marketplace) |
| **Integration** | All services coordinated (one platform) | Fragmented (separate providers) |
| **Geographic Focus** | Tier-2 first (Vizag → expansion) | Metro-centric |
| **Pricing Transparency** | Upfront, no hidden costs | Opaque or premium-only |
| **Community Support** | Peer groups, WhatsApp communities | Isolated coaching |
| **Scope** | Metabolic health (diabetes, PCOS, obesity, hormones) | Weight loss only or general wellness |

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

**1. Trust Through Hybrid Model:**
- Physical consultations in Vizag build credibility (Tier-2 patients skeptical of pure telemedicine)
- Digital follow-up provides convenience after trust established
- HealthifyRx can't replicate without changing entire digital-only model

**2. Medical Rigor Creates Switching Costs:**
- Endocrinologist relationships are sticky (6-12 month programs)
- Medical history, progress tracking, personalized protocols create lock-in
- Competitors (coach-led) can't handle complex cases requiring medical expertise

**3. Regional Dominance Before National Scale:**
- First-mover in Vizag (2M+ population, 100K+ with metabolic disorders)
- Founder's local credibility accelerates adoption
- By the time national players notice, MetaboWell owns regional market

**4. Integrated Care Reduces Friction:**
- Patients don't have to coordinate doctors, labs, pharmacies, dieticians separately
- "One platform, one team, one journey" eliminates fragmentation
- Creates value proposition competitors can't match without massive integration

**5. Community and Belonging Drive Retention:**
- Peer support groups reduce isolation
- Sense of belonging transforms from service to lifestyle
- Big platforms optimize for scale—MetaboWell optimizes for relationships

### Out of Scope for MVP

**❌ Deliberately Excluded (Phase 2+):**

1. **Mobile App:** Web-first for MVP (mobile app in Phase 2)
2. **Peer Support Groups (In-Platform):** Start with WhatsApp groups manually, add to platform later
3. **Gamification:** Duolingo-style streaks, badges—nice-to-have, add post-launch
4. **AI Pattern Recognition:** Need data first—add in Phase 3
5. **Daily Micro-Content Drip:** Start with core library, add content pipeline later
6. **Smart Scale Integration/Wearables:** Manual weight entry fine for MVP
7. **Multi-Language Support:** English + Hindi only for V1, expand to regional languages (Telugu) in Phase 2
8. **Mood/Emotional Tracking:** "How We Feel" adaptation—add post-launch based on demand
9. **Netflix-Style Content Recommendations:** V1 has static content library
10. **Swiggy-Style Delivery Tracking:** Simple notifications adequate for MVP
11. **Fitness Tracking Integration:** Nice-to-have but not core value proposition
12. **Recipe Database:** Dieticians provide personalized meal plans instead (higher value)
13. **Advanced Social Features:** No public profiles, likes, social feed (keep simple peer groups only)

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

**1. Regulatory Compliance Risk (CRITICAL - Existential):**
- **Description:** Indian Telemedicine Practice Guidelines may require in-person first consultation for GLP-1 medications (Schedule H/H1/X drugs). Could force hybrid model from day 1 or block telemedicine prescriptions entirely.
- **Impact:** Could fundamentally change MVP scope (need clinic partnerships before launch, adds 2-3 months), or require pivot to post-prescription support only model.
- **Mitigation:** Engage healthcare regulatory lawyer immediately (Week 1-4), understand GLP-1 Schedule classification, determine first consultation requirements, finalize business model based on findings.

**2. Trust Deficit Risk (HIGH - Acquisition Barrier):**
- **Description:** "Is this a scam?" perception in first 30 seconds. Zero social proof at launch (no testimonials, reviews, track record). Chicken-and-egg: need patients to build proof, need proof to get patients.
- **Impact:** Low conversion rates, high CAC, slow growth.
- **Mitigation:** "Do things that don't scale" (personal outreach, doctor referrals, local events), university/research partnership for credibility, transparent credentials display, free assessment to build trust before commitment.

**3. Doctor Recruitment Risk (HIGH - Operational Dependency):**
- **Description:** Need credible endocrinologists willing to experiment with telemedicine model. Reputation protection concerns (bad reviews, social media attacks). May demand higher commissions or leave for competitors.
- **Impact:** Delayed launch, limited capacity, quality issues.
- **Mitigation:** Reputation protection protocols (internal dispute resolution, verified reviews only), competitive compensation (₹1,000-₹1,500 per consultation), pilot proof before committing (show evidence model works), voice-to-text notes as adoption driver (time savings).

**4. Competitive Response Risk (MEDIUM - Market Timing):**
- **Description:** HealthifyRx, Mosaic Wellness, Apollo could launch metabolic health verticals or enter Tier-2 markets aggressively. Well-funded competitors (₹100Cr+ funding) could outspend on marketing, undercut pricing.
- **Impact:** Market share erosion, CAC inflation, pricing pressure.
- **Mitigation:** Move fast (launch in 6 months), build regional dominance (Vizag first), emphasize personal touch moat (hard to copy at scale), establish category leadership (thought leadership, content marketing).

**5. Patient Retention Risk (MEDIUM - Churn Sensitivity):**
- **Description:** Patients may leave after losing weight (6-12 months), feel they can manage maintenance alone, or doctors may poach patients off-platform.
- **Impact:** Lower LTV than projected (₹30K), unsustainable unit economics.
- **Mitigation:** Shift from transactional to relational ("metabolic health lifestyle community"), community building (peer groups, WhatsApp), long-term maintenance programs (post-GLP-1 off-ramp), medical reality helps (weight rebound = retention).

**6. Pricing Sensitivity Risk (MEDIUM - Market Acceptance):**
- **Description:** ₹3,500/month + medication (₹6,000-₹20,000/month total) may be too expensive for Tier-2 market. Competitors could launch free telemedicine or lower pricing.
- **Impact:** Low conversion rates, need to reduce pricing (hurts margins).
- **Mitigation:** Results justify premium (testimonials, before/after transformations), demonstrate ROI (platform fee tiny vs. diabetes complications), pricing flexibility (tiered plans, corporate subsidies), free assessment lowers barrier.

**7. Technology MVP Risk (MEDIUM - Quality Concerns):**
- **Description:** Outsourced development may result in buggy platform, poor UX, unreliable video consultations. Could damage brand, reduce retention.
- **Impact:** Low satisfaction, high churn, reputation damage.
- **Mitigation:** Rigorous QA, beta testing (20-50 users), reliable vendor selection (SLA agreements), plan in-house CTO hire (Phase 2 after seed).

**8. Pharmacy Partnership Risk (LOW-MEDIUM - Fulfillment Dependency):**
- **Description:** Pharmacy partnerships (or direct manufacturer partnerships) may be slow to establish, unreliable fulfillment, or demand unfavorable terms.
- **Impact:** Medication access delays, patient frustration, revenue loss.
- **Mitigation:** Multiple pharmacy partners (redundancy), direct manufacturer outreach (Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk) in parallel, manual workflows initially if needed.
