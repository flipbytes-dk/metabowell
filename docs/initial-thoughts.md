As  an obese man or woman, I have tried many diets, exercise, fasting etc and lost weight but the weight has always come back after sometime. Recently ive heard about the GLP-1 drugs like MOUNJARO launched by ELI LILLY in India and known as ZEPBOUND in the USA for last few years.

Now there is no long term use of these GLP-1 drugs in India so the information is not freely available nor are doctors everywhere fully conversant with these drugs. The drugs though found to be generally safe have side effects especially when starting or even when titrating to the next dose. There are also some major  if rare side effects that also need to be monitored in patients.

These drugs need a doctors physical examination, tests etc before starting the medication. The patient also needs some handholding through the startup process as well as when side effects or other events happen. This is missing in India at the moment as doctors typically have a examine and prescribe system and no support.Plateaus in weight loss for example are common and doctors support and timely advise is critical in keeping the momentum going.

 For testing, if a reputed test lab is tied up, the patients ease of getting treatment improves.

In order for the drugs to work, which basically suppress hunger, cause satiety, slow down digestion and reduce food noise, there have to be lifestyle changes. These include change of nutrition, increase activity, intake of liquid, and supplements when required etc. This work of a dietician as part of this journey is critical to make this medication work. 

Some counselling or support group will also help to manage emotional eating or frustration on slow progress by some as compared to others and hence encouragement is very important.

Access to these drugs through pharmacies who have a discount system will make these drugs more affordable and widespread so a tie up with them or the manufacturer will be ideal. They can be delivered to the patient directly rather than them come and collect.

These drugs are not just weight loss and type-2 diabetes control but are a long term health journey as once a patient reaches the ideal weight, they can titrate down and stay at a minimum dose which the doctor can prescribe.

As these new drugs are gaining traction, mounjaro has become the 2nd highest selling branded drug in india in august 2025 AND eli lilly is investing in a 1 billiion dollar plant in india to make thse and next generation drugs.

The 1st generation drugs made by novo nordisk called WEGOVY /  OZEMPIC (semaglutide) are also coming to end of patent next year and will be made by Indian pharma companies making them even more widely available and cheaper bringing 100s of thousands of Indians into the GLP-1 fold.

A platform to meet the goals of patients as well as connecting to the various doctors, test labs, manufacturers etc will be of immense help to patients.
