## Overview

**MetaboWell** is an integrated GLP-1 weight loss care platform launching in India, targeting Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. The platform combines teleconsultations, lab diagnostics, pharmacy coordination, dietician support, and peer community into a seamless patient journey focused on:

- **GLP-1 Medical Weight Loss** (Tirzepatide/Mounjaro, Semaglutide/Ozempic)
- **Continuous Care Coordination** (not "prescribe and abandon")
- **Nutrition & Lifestyle Guidance**
- **Long-term Metabolic Health Management**

**14 core features identified for launch:**
1. Patient onboarding (frictionless, conversational)
2. Doctor marketplace (video consultations)
3. Digital health records (EHR)
4. WhatsApp support integration

- [ ] Doctor recruitment preparation (list 20-30 targets)
- [ ] Competitive intelligence (1mg, Practo, hospital programs)
- [ ] Financial modeling (unit economics, funding needs)

## Competitive Advantage

- **Continuous Care Model** - Fills massive gap where Indian healthcare abandons patients after prescription
- **Personal Touch at Scale** - High-touch service (same doctor, success coaches, personal milestones) that big platforms can't replicate
- **Integrated Ecosystem** - Doctors + Labs + Pharmacy + Dieticians + Community in ONE coordinated experience
- **Community as Retention Driver** - Sense of belonging, peer support, lifelong relationships (3-5 year LTV)
- **Lifelong Patient Relationships** - Medical reality (weight rebound) + platform stickiness = long-term retention
- **First-Mover in Category** - GLP-1 in India is nascent, opportunity to establish standards

## Market Opportunity

- **Current Market:** Mounjaro became 2nd highest-selling branded drug in India (August 2025)
- **Market Expansion:** Generic semaglutide (Wegovy/Ozempic) patents expire 2026 - Indian pharma will flood market
- **Tier 1 Cities:** Early adopters, awareness high, willing to pay premium (launch focus)
- **Tier 2 Cities:** 10x market size of Tier 1, will drive volume as generics arrive and awareness spreads
- **Total Addressable Market:** Adults 30-65 struggling with obesity across India (300M+ potential patients)
- **Perfect Timing:** Eli Lilly investing $1 billion in India plant, GLP-1 medications about to become widely available and affordable
